    "# Topic Modeling: Organizing Unlabeled CVs with LDA\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **Topic Modeling** using **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** to organize unlabeled CVs (resumes) by automatically discovering hidden topics. Unlike supervised classification, topic modeling works with completely unlabeled data, making it ideal for organizing large document collections without manual labeling. You'll learn how to apply LDA to discover topics, interpret results, and organize documents based on their dominant topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The best way to find a needle in a haystack is to organize the haystack first.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem**: You have a folder full of CVs—unlabeled, unorganized. You need to find candidates for specific roles, but manually reading through hundreds of CVs is impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand what Topic Modeling is and why it's useful for unsupervised document organization\n",
    "- Learn how LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) discovers hidden topics in text collections\n",
    "- Apply LDA to organize unlabeled documents automatically\n",
    "- Interpret topic modeling results by examining top words and document-topic distributions\n",
    "- Organize documents into folders based on their dominant topics\n",

    "\n",
    "**Topic Modeling** is an **unsupervised learning** task that discovers hidden topics in a collection of unlabeled documents. Unlike classification (which requires labeled data), topic modeling finds patterns automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example applications:**\n",
    "- **Organizing unlabeled documents**: Group CVs by field (AI/ML, Data Analysis, etc.) without manual labeling\n",
    "- **Understanding large text collections**: Discover what themes exist in news archives, research papers, or social media\n",
    "- **Content recommendation**: Find documents similar to a given document based on topic similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it's useful:**\n",
    "- No labels needed: works with completely unlabeled data\n",
    "- Interpretable: topics are defined by their top words, making them understandable\n",
    "- Scalable: can process large document collections\n",
    "- Flexible: number of topics can be adjusted based on the corpus"

    "\n",
    "**Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** is a probabilistic model that discovers hidden topics in a collection of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key idea**: \n",
    "- Each document is a **mixture of topics** (e.g., 70% AI/ML, 20% Data Analysis, 10% Software Engineering)\n",
    "- Each topic is a **distribution over words** (e.g., Topic 1: 30% \"PyTorch\", 25% \"TensorFlow\", 20% \"NLP\"...)\n",
    "- LDA discovers these topics automatically by finding words that co-occur together\n",
    "\n",
    "**For our CVs**: LDA will discover topics like \"AI/ML\", \"Data Analysis\", \"Big Data\" by looking at which words appear together, then assign each CV to the most relevant topic(s).\n",

    "\n",
    "By completing this module, you can now:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Build supervised ML text classification pipelines**\n",
    "- Preprocess Arabic and English text\n",
    "- Vectorize text using BoW and TF-IDF\n",
    "- Train and evaluate classifiers\n",
    "- Interpret model results\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Apply keyword-based information retrieval**\n",
    "- Implement TF-IDF-based search engines\n",
    "- Measure document similarity using cosine similarity\n",
    "- Rank and retrieve relevant documents\n",

    "✅ **Apply unsupervised ML for document organization**\n",
    "- Discover hidden topics using LDA\n",
    "- Organize unlabeled documents automatically\n",
    "- Interpret topic modeling results\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Foundation for What's Next\n",
    "\n",
    "This module focused on **statistical NLP**—traditional methods that work well for many tasks. In **Module 2**, you'll learn about **Deep Learning approaches** (embeddings, transformers) that build on these foundations to achieve even better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you learned here is still valuable:**\n",
    "- Preprocessing techniques apply to both statistical and deep learning methods\n",
    "- Understanding vectorization helps you understand embeddings\n",
    "- EDA is always the first step, regardless of the approach\n",
    "- The pipeline structure (preprocess → vectorize → model) remains the same\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving to Module 2, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **When would you use statistical NLP vs. deep learning?**\n",
    "   - Statistical NLP: Fast, interpretable, works with small data\n",
    "   - Deep Learning: Better accuracy, requires more data and computation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What preprocessing steps are most important?**\n",
    "   - Depends on your data and task, but EDA always guides the decision\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How does TF-IDF differ from BoW?**\n",
    "   - BoW: Simple word counts\n",
    "   - TF-IDF: Weighted counts that emphasize distinctive words\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **When would you use topic modeling vs. classification?**\n",
    "   - Classification: When you have labels and want to predict categories\n",
    "   - Topic Modeling: When you have no labels and want to discover structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Journey Continues\n",
    "\n",
    "You've built a solid foundation in statistical NLP. The concepts you've learned—preprocessing, vectorization, classification, retrieval, and topic modeling—are the building blocks for more advanced techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Module Preview:**\n",
    "- **Module 2** introduces **Deep Learning for NLP**:\n",
    "  - Tokenization with modern tools (WordPiece, BPE)\n",
    "  - Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, contextual embeddings)\n",
    "  - Transformers and BERT\n",
    "  - Fine-tuning pre-trained models\n",
    "\n",
    "The journey from statistical NLP to deep learning is a natural progression—you'll see how embeddings generalize vectorization, how transformers improve on traditional methods, and how pre-trained models leverage the foundations you've built.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module 1 Complete! 🎉**\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have the skills to work with text data using statistical methods. You understand the complete pipeline from raw text to actionable insights, and you're ready to explore the power of deep learning in Module 2."
