        "This lab provides hands-on practice building a complete **Search Engine** from scratch using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**, one of the most common techniques in Information Retrieval. You'll work with real datasets, implement TF-IDF vectorization, measure document similarity using cosine similarity, and build a functional search engine that can retrieve and rank documents based on user queries. This lab demonstrates the practical application of IR concepts in building production-ready search systems."

You can also buy\\ntransformers for quite a bit less and wire them yourself.
