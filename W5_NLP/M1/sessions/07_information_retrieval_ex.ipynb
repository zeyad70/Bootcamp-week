    "This lab provides hands-on practice building a complete **Search Engine** from scratch using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**, one of the most common techniques in Information Retrieval. You'll work with real datasets, implement TF-IDF vectorization, measure document similarity using cosine similarity, and build a functional search engine that can retrieve and rank documents based on user queries. This lab demonstrates the practical application of IR concepts in building production-ready search systems."

    "\n",
    "**Information Retrieval (IR)**: The task of finding information (usually documents) that satisfies an information need from within large collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Corpus**: A collection of documents. In IR, this is the entire set of documents we search through.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query**: A user's information need expressed in natural language (e.g., \"What is machine learning?\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**Document**: A unit of information in the corpus (e.g., a web page, article, or text passage).\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: A numerical statistic that reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection. As you learned in the vectorization lesson:\n",
    "- **TF (Term Frequency)**: How often a term appears in a document\n",
    "- **IDF (Inverse Document Frequency)**: How rare or common a term is across the entire corpus\n",
    "- **TF-IDF**: TF × IDF, giving higher weight to terms that are frequent in a document but rare in the corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vector Space Model**: A model where documents and queries are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space. Similarity is measured using the angle between vectors (cosine similarity).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cosine Similarity**: A measure of similarity between two vectors. It measures the cosine of the angle between them, ranging from -1 to 1 (or 0 to 1 for non-negative vectors like TF-IDF).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sparse Matrix**: A matrix where most elements are zero. TF-IDF vectors are typically sparse because most words don't appear in most documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval**: The process of finding and ranking documents in response to a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ranking**: Ordering retrieved documents by their relevance score (highest to lowest)."
