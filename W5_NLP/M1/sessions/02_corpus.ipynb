We explore what corpora are, different types of corpora, and the importance of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for text data. Understanding your corpus through EDA is crucial before preprocessing, as it helps identify data quality issues, vocabulary characteristics, and preprocessing needs that will guide your entire NLP pipeline.\n"

    "2. **Building domain-specific NLP applications**\n",
    "3. **Statistical analysis of language patterns**\n",

    "## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is the process of understanding your data *before* you start preprocessing or modeling. For text data, EDA helps you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Identify data quality issues** early (wrong language, duplicates, outliers)\n",
    "- **Understand vocabulary characteristics** (size, frequency patterns, class-specific words)\n",
    "- **Determine preprocessing needs** (what noise to remove, what to normalize)\n",
    "- **Make informed decisions** about your NLP pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Analogy**: EDA is like inspecting ingredients before cooking. You check if vegetables are fresh, if you have the right quantities, and if anything needs cleaning. Similarly, EDA helps you understand your text data before \"cooking\" (preprocessing and modeling).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why EDA Matters for Text\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without EDA**, you might:\n",
    "- Preprocess incorrectly (e.g., remove important punctuation)\n",
    "- Miss data quality issues (duplicates, wrong language)\n",
    "- Choose wrong preprocessing steps (e.g., stemming when lemmatization is better)\n",
    "- Build models on biased or poor-quality data\n",
    "\n",
    "**With EDA**, you:\n",
    "- Make informed preprocessing decisions\n",
    "- Catch data issues early\n",
    "- Understand what your model will learn from\n",
    "- Validate that preprocessing improved your data\n",
    "\n",
    "### EDA Components for Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Data Quality Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class Distribution**: Are categories balanced or imbalanced?\n",
    "- **Balanced**: Equal number of examples per class (e.g., 50% positive, 50% negative)\n",
    "- **Imbalanced**: One class dominates (e.g., 90% positive, 10% negative)\n",
    "- **Why it matters**: Imbalanced data can bias models toward the majority class\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text Length Distribution**: How long are your texts?\n",
    "- Very short texts (1-5 words) might be incomplete or noisy\n",
    "- Very long texts (1000+ words) might be concatenated or need chunking\n",
    "- Most texts should fall within a reasonable range\n",
    "\n",
    "**Language Detection**: Is the text in the expected language?\n",
    "- Mixed languages need special handling\n",
    "- Wrong language indicates data collection issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duplicate Detection**: Are there duplicate documents?\n",
    "- Duplicates can bias training (model sees same example multiple times)\n",
    "- Need to identify and remove duplicates before training\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Vocabulary Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vocabulary Size**: How many unique words?\n",
    "- Small vocabulary (< 1000 words): Limited diversity, might need more data\n",
    "- Large vocabulary (> 100,000 words): High diversity, might need dimensionality reduction\n",
    "- Affects vectorization complexity and model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word Frequency Patterns**: Which words are most common?\n",
    "- Very common words (appear in >80% of documents) might be stop words\n",
    "- Rare words (appear in <2 documents) might be typos or noise\n",
    "- Helps identify stop words to remove\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class-Specific Patterns**: Do certain words appear more in certain classes?\n",
    "- Words that appear mostly in one class are good features for classification\n",
    "- Helps with feature selection and model interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Preprocessing Needs Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Noise Patterns**: What needs to be removed?\n",
    "- URLs, emails, hashtags, mentions (@user)\n",
    "- HTML tags, special characters\n",
    "- Identified through EDA by examining sample texts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normalization Needs**: What needs to be standardized?\n",
    "- Case variations (UPPERCASE, lowercase, Title Case)\n",
    "- Contractions (\"don't\" vs \"do not\")\n",
    "- Elongations (\"loooove\" vs \"love\")\n",
    "- Diacritics (in Arabic: \"الكتاب\" vs \"الكتاب\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outliers**: Unusually long or short texts\n",
    "- Very long texts might be concatenated (need splitting)\n",
    "- Very short texts might be incomplete (need filtering)"
