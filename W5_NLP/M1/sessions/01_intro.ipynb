    "## Challenges of NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "Language is complex and nuanced. NLP faces several challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ambiguity (الغموض)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lexical ambiguity** is a subtype of semantic ambiguity where a word or morpheme is ambiguous.\n",
    "- \"The fisherman went to the bank\"\n",
    "  - \"bank\" could either mean \"river bank\" or the \"bank building\"\n",
    "- \"شربت من العين\" (نبع الماء).\n",
    "- \"أبصرت بـ العين\" (عضو البصر).\n",
    "- \"أرسل القائد عيناً لاستطلاع العدو\" (جاسوساً).\n",
    "- \"اشتريت هذا بعينه\" (بذاته/نفسه).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Homonymy** (التجانس اللفظي) happens when words are pronounced the same way.\n",
    "- \"this is a row of raw materials\"\n",
    "- \"I see the sea\"\n",
    "- \"Without my glasses I can't see the glass\"\n",
    "- مثال (كلمة \"ذهَب\"):\n",
    "  - \"خاتم من ذَهَب\" (المعدن النفيس).\n",
    "  - \"ذَهَبَ محمد إلى المدرسة\" (فعل ماضٍ بمعنى مشى/غادر).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantic ambiguity** (الغموض الدلالي) results from expressions having multiple meanings.\n",
    "- \"It’s on the house.\" -- could mean something is free, or an object could literally be found on the house.\n",
    "- \"that went over my head\" -- could express confusion or that something literally passed over their head\n",
    "- \"not your business\"\n",
    "- مثال: \"طارت الطيور بأرزاقها\"\n",
    "  - المعنى الحرفي: الطيور أخذت الطعام وطارت.\n",
    "  - المعنى المقصود: فات الأوان وانتهت الفرصة.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntactic Ambiguity** happens when the sentence has multiple parse trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"I saw the man on the beach with my binoculars.\" -- could mean that I saw a man through my binoculars or the man had my binoculars with him.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference: https://cs.nyu.edu/~davise/ai/ambiguity.html\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Irony and sarcasm\n",
    "\n",
    "Any time you say the opposite of the truth intentionally for effect, that’s verbal irony.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sarcasm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"I love it when my computer crashes.\"\n",
    "- \"Oh, fantastic! I just love waiting in line for hours.\"\n",
    "- عندما يرتكب شخص خطأ فادحاً فتقول له: \"ما شاء الله، عبقري!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Irony:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Verbal: \"جيتك يا عبد المعين تعين لقيتك يا عبد المعين تنعان\"\n",
    "- Situational:\n",
    "  - A Doctor that smokes cigarettes.\n",
    "  - \"باب النجار مخلّع\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Irony and sarcasm present problems for machine learning models because they generally use words and phrases that, strictly by definition, may be positive or negative, but actually connote the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dialects\n",
    "\n",
    "Dialects are variations of a language spoken in different regions or by different social groups. For example, American English and British English have different spellings, pronunciations, and vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Water and \"Wadder\"\n",
    "- \"Ain't no thang\" vs. \"It's no problem\": This phrase is common in some dialects of American English, but it might be unfamiliar to others.\n",
    "- \"Y'all\" vs. \"you guys\": This is a regional difference in addressing a group of people, with \"y'all\" being more common in the Southern United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "اختلاف المفردات (مثال: \"كيف حالك؟\"):\n",
    "- الفصحى: كيف حالك؟\n",
    "- الخليجية: شلونك؟ / شعلومك؟\n",
    "- المصرية: إزيك؟ / عامل إيه؟\n",
    "- الشامية: كيفك؟\n",
    "- المغربية: كيداير؟ / لباس؟\n",
    "\n",
    "أدوات النفي (مثال: \"ما أكلت\"):\n",
    "- المصرية/الشامية: ما اكلتش / ما اكلت.\n",
    "- الخليجية: ما كليت / مو ماكل.\n",
    "- المغربية: ما كليتش.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Slang and jargon\n",
    "\n",
    "Slang and jargon are informal words and phrases used in specific contexts or by particular groups of people. They can be difficult for machines to understand because they are constantly evolving and can have multiple meanings. Examples:\n",
    "- \"That movie was lit!\" (meaning: the movie was excellent)\n",
    "- \"I'm feeling blue.\" (meaning: I'm feeling sad)\n",
    "- \"Google it!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"كبّر دماغك\": تعني تجاهل الأمر (وليست دعوة طبية لتكبير الرأس).\n",
    "- \"سحَب عليه\": (السعودية/الخليج) تعني تجاهله أو لم يذهب لموعده.\n",
    "- \"قصف جبهته\": تعني أحرجه برد قوي ومفحم.\n",
    "\n",

    "- \"KPI\" (key performance indicator)\n",
    "- \"ML\" (machine learning)"
