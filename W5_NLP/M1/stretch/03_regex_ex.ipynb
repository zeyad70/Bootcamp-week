    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains hands-on exercises to practice and reinforce your understanding of Regular Expressions (Regex). Through these exercises, you'll apply regex patterns to solve real-world text processing problems, from basic character matching to complex pattern extraction. These exercises will help you build the practical skills needed for data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature extraction in NLP pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Practice writing regex patterns for common text matching scenarios\n",
    "- Apply character classes, quantifiers, and anchors to solve problems\n",
    "- Extract and manipulate text using regex groups and capturing\n",
    "- Translate natural language requirements into regex patterns\n",
    "- Debug and refine regex patterns using practical examples\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exercise Set 1: The Basics** - Character classes and simple patterns\n",
    "2. **Exercise Set 2: Quantifiers and Repetition** - Matching multiple occurrences\n",
    "3. **Exercise Set 3: Anchors and Boundaries** - Position-based matching\n",
    "4. **Exercise Set 4: Groups and Capturing** - Extracting specific parts of matches\n",
    "5. **Exercise Set 5: Real-world Applications** - Practical text processing scenarios"

    "\n",
    "- **Practice is essential** for mastering regex patterns - start with simple character classes and gradually work up to complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Character classes** `[ ]` are fundamental for matching sets of characters, with negation `[^]` and ranges `[a-z]` being powerful tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantifiers** (`*`, `+`, `?`, `{}`) control repetition and are crucial for matching variable-length patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Anchors** (`^`, `$`, `\\b`) match positions rather than characters, enabling precise pattern matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Groups** `()` allow you to capture and extract specific parts of matches, which is essential for data extraction tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Word boundaries** `\\b` are essential for matching complete words without partial matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Testing and debugging** regex patterns is easier with online tools like regex101.com before implementing in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Real-world regex applications require combining multiple concepts: character classes, quantifiers, anchors, and groups work together to solve complex text processing problems."
