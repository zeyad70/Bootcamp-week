Regex provides a concise and flexible way to search, match, and manipulate text patterns, making it indispensable for data cleaning, preprocessing, feature extraction, and validation tasks. We'll learn the syntax, metacharacters, and practical applications of regex in machine learning and deep learning workflows, with a focus on real-world use cases in text preprocessing and data wrangling."

        "  - **Weak Supervision & Labeling**: Creating rule-based labels for unlabeled data\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Character Classes** `[ ]` allow matching sets of characters:\n",
        "  - `[abc]` matches a, b, or c\n",
        "  - `[^abc]` matches any character except a, b, or c\n",
        "  - `[a-z]` matches any lowercase letter from a to z\n",

        "- **Metacharacters** have special meanings: `. ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] \\ | ( )`\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Quantifiers** control how many times a pattern matches:\n",
        "  - `*` (0 or more), `+` (1 or more), `?` (0 or 1), `{n}` (exactly n), `{n,m}` (between n and m)\n",

        "- **Anchors** match positions: `^` (start), `$` (end), `\\b` (word boundary)\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Groups** `()` allow capturing and extracting specific parts of matches\n",
