## Module 1: Text Analysis

Key Skills:

- Build, evaluate, and improve supervised ML text classification pipeline
- Apply keyword-based information retrieval algorithms to find specific data in this unstructured lump of text
- Apply unsupervised ML to cluster documents and terms to gain insights on unorganized unlabeled data and find interesting patterns of the groups

## Module 2: NLP with PyTorch (Deep Learning)

Key Skills:

- Understand Tokenization by comparing a manual, from-scratch approach with the use of a modern, pre-trained tool
- Understand Embeddings by visualizing pre-trained models and build one from scratch
- Distinguish how `input_ids` and `attention_mask` relate to tokens and embeddings
- Preparing a custom `Dataset` + `DataCollatorWithPadding` for efficient batching
- Fine-tune pre-trained contextual embedding models (like BERT) on custom dataset for higher classification accuracy
