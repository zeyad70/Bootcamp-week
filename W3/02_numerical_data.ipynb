    "- The number `$10` million in house prices is a lot. Similarly, the number `20` in the number of rooms is a lot. After scaling, we find big values (regardless of scale) are close to 1. Also, we find small values (regardless of scale) are close to 0.\n",

    "### Linear scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear scaling** (more commonly shortened to just **scaling**) means converting floating-point values from their natural range into a standard range—usually 0 to 1 or -1 to +1. See [`MinMaxScaler`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) in scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage**: Linear scaling is effective when these conditions are met:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stable Bounds:** The minimum and maximum values of the feature remain relatively consistent over time.\n",
    "2. **Few Outliers:** The feature has minimal outliers, and those that exist are not significantly extreme.\n",
    "3. **Uniform Distribution:** The feature's values are distributed evenly across its range.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Human Age**\n",
    "\n",
    "Human age is a good candidate for linear scaling because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Its range is well-defined (typically 0 to 100 years).\n",
    "- Outliers are rare (a very small percentage of people live beyond 100).\n",
    "- A large dataset should provide sufficient representation of all age groups, even if some are more common.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Most real-world features do not meet all of the criteria for linear scaling. **Z-score scaling is typically a better normalization choice than linear scaling**."

For instance, a net_worth feature might exhibit most values within 3 standard deviations, but a few could be hundreds of standard deviations away.

While most values are normally distributed, a few extreme outliers exist, such as households with an exceptionally high number of rooms per person.\n",
